            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Sunday Morning Adventures is a small group of friends who play tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) every other Sunday. We play virtually using Discord and our imaginations, usually for about two hours per session. Our group is primarily based in Southeast Michigan and Southern Ohio, with members ranging from their early 30s to mid-40s.</p>

            <h2>Our Games</h2>
            <p>We started with <em>Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition</em> but have since explored various other game systems and genres. As the group’s DM/GM, I primarily run campaigns that span multiple sessions, creating long-term, immersive storytelling experiences. During certain holidays, Len, a long-time TTRPG player, leads special themed one-shots, providing a fun and unique gaming experience in just one or two sessions.</p>

            <h2>Our Community</h2>
            <p>Diversity and inclusion are key to our group’s ethos. Our members come from different backgrounds, making our gaming table a welcoming and enriching space. Through storytelling, collaboration, and creativity, Sunday Morning Adventures celebrates the joy of tabletop role-playing games and the friendships they foster.</p>
